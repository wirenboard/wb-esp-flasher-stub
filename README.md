# Wiren Board fork

This is a fork of `esp-flasher-stub` made while speeding up ESP32 production flashing on the
Wiren Board test stand (the module is flashed over a built-in CH343 USB-UART bridge). It adds the
changes below on top of upstream; each is described here. The upstream README follows further down.

## 1. UART clock/APB boost on ESP32

Upstream raises the CPU/APB clock (`stub_lib_clock_init()`, APB 40 → 80 MHz) **only for USB
transports**; over a plain UART the stub keeps running at the ROM download clock, which throttles
flash writes. The gate exists because the ESP32-S3 UART path was unstable without setting DBIAS.

The ESP32 target's `stub_target_clock_init()` **does** set DBIAS (`RTC_CNTL_DBIAS_1V25`), so the
boost is safe for UART there. We enable it for UART, **gated to esp32 only** — via an `ESP32`
compile macro defined by the build for `TARGET_CHIP=esp32` (same style as the existing `ESP8266`
macro); every other target keeps upstream USB-only behaviour. Boosting the APB changes the ROM-set
UART baud divider, so the divider is reprogrammed for the current link baud (115200) right after
the boost, otherwise the `OHAI` handshake is corrupted. Measured ~+12–17% flash-write throughput
on ESP32-U4WDH over a CH343 USB-UART.

# ESP Flasher Stub

ESP Flasher Stub is a set of small firmware programs (stubs) that run on Espressif ESP chips to enable fast and reliable flash programming via [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/). When esptool connects to an ESP chip, it uploads the flasher stub into the chip's RAM. The stub then takes over communication, providing faster flash operations and additional features compared to the chip's built-in ROM bootloader.

This project has replaced the deprecated [legacy flasher stub of esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool-legacy-flasher-stub/) and is the default flasher stub since esptool [v5.3](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases/tag/v5.3.0).

## Supported Chips

| Architecture | Chips |
|---|---|
| Xtensa | ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 |
| RISC-V | ESP32-C2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C6, ESP32-C61, ESP32-H2, ESP32-H4, ESP32-P4, ESP32-P4 (rev1) |
| Xtensa (LX106) | ESP8266 |

## Build Dependencies

### Submodules

The project depends on [esp-stub-lib](https://github.com/espressif/esp-stub-lib/) as a git submodule. Make sure to initialize it before building:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Toolchains

The following toolchains must be set up and available in your PATH:
1. [`xtensa-lx106-elf-*`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
2. [`xtensa-*-elf-*`](https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG)
3. [`riscv32-esp-elf-*`](https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG)

There is a convenience script for AMD64 Linux machines to download and install them into the `toolchains` directory:
```sh
mkdir -p toolchains
cd toolchains
../tools/setup_toolchains.sh
```

Then source the export script in every terminal where the project is used:
```sh
. ./tools/export_toolchains.sh
```

### Python Dependencies

[pyelftools](https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools) is needed for ELF file analysis. Install it in a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pyelftools
```

Activate the virtual environment in every terminal where the project is used:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Target tests only:** Running or building the target tests in `unittests/target/` additionally
> requires [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/) (`pip install esptool`). It is used
> to convert compiled ELF files to loadable binaries (`elf2image`) and to upload them to hardware
> (`load_ram`). Host tests (`unittests/host/`) have no esptool dependency.

## How to Build

### Build for One Selected Chip Target

```sh
mkdir -p build
cmake . -B build -G Ninja -DTARGET_CHIP=esp32s2   # Replace with your desired chip, e.g. esp32, esp8266
ninja -C build
```

### Build for All Supported Chip Targets

```sh
./tools/build_all_chips.sh
```

## How to Use with Esptool

1. Install esptool in [development mode](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/contributing.html#development-setup).
2. Obtain the flasher stub binaries as JSON files either from the [releases page](https://github.com/espressif/esp-flasher-stub/releases) or from the artifacts of your pull request.
3. Replace the esptool JSON files in the `esptool/targets/stub_flasher` directory with the obtained JSON files.

    Example copy command (adjust the path to your esptool directory):

    ```sh
    cp build-*/*.json ~/esptool/esptool/targets/stub_flasher/1/
    ```

## How It Works

The flasher stub operates through upload, initialization, handshake (`OHAI` over the selected transport), and a command loop that handles flash, memory, register, and SPI operations. UART and USB transports use SLIP framing; SDIO uses raw command frames. For details, see the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) document.
